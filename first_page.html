        Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills, 
        there was a garden that no one dared to enter. 
        Hidden behind an ancient iron gate, its entrance was 
        obscured by ivy and wildflowers that seemed to grow with a mind of 
        their own. The villagers called it The Enchanted Gardenâ€”a place spoken 
        of in hushed tones, full of mystery and magic.

     <pre>
        Legend had it that the garden was the work of a powerful sorceress named 
        Elara,who had lived many centuries ago.Elara was said to have been a 
        guardian of nature,weaving spells that kept the world in balance. But
        as the years passed,her magic grew more unpredictable, and the garden began
        to take on a life of its own. Flowers would bloom in the dead of winter,
        trees would whisper secrets to those who listened closely, and strange lights
        danced in the twilight.
     </pre>

        No one knew for sure what lay beyond the garden gate. Some said it was a 
        paradise of unparalleled beauty, while others warned of its dangers. 
        Most believed it was better left untouched,for to enter was to risk being lost 
        to its enchantment forever.

        That is, until one bright spring morning, a curious girl named Lila arrived in the village.
     </pre>

        Lila had always been drawn to places of wonder, her heart full of questions about the world.
        Her family had moved from the city, seeking peace in the quiet village, but Lila could never 
        shake the sense that there was something special about this land, something hidden just beyond 
        the horizon. She had heard the whispers of The Enchanted Garden as she wandered the village,
        and her curiosity grew with every passing day.
