    I set out on a journey, wild and free,
    Through bustling streets and tranquil seas.
    The mountains called, their peaks so high,
    Under the vast and endless sky. <br>
    I wandered through lands unknown,
    Where ancient tales and dreams are sown.
    In distant villages, strangers smiled,
    Their stories deep, their hearts beguiled
    I walked through deserts, felt the breeze,
    Explored the forests, among the trees. <br>
    Every step brought something new,
    A world of wonders, endless and true.
    In crowded markets, colors bloomed,
    On quiet trails, silence loomed. <br>
    I met new faces, shared a laugh,
    Traced history's path, and took its draft.
    Though my travels came to an end,
    Each place, each person, became a friend.
    The road, the sky, the world, so wide,
    Left their mark upon my mind. <br>
    In the book of life, my journey's page,
    A story written, timeless, sage. <br>
