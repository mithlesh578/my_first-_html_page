            I set out on a journey, wild and free,
            Through bustling streets and tranquil seas.
            The mountains called, their peaks so high,
            Under the vast and endless sky.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            I wandered through lands unknown,
            Where ancient tales and dreams are sown.
            In distant villages, strangers smiled,
            Their stories deep, their hearts beguiled
        </pre>
        <pre>
            I walked through deserts, felt the breeze,
            Explored the forests, among the trees.
            Every step brought something new,
            A world of wonders, endless and true.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            In crowded markets, colors bloomed,
            On quiet trails, silence loomed.
            I met new faces, shared a laugh,
            Traced history's path, and took its draft.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            Though my travels came to an end,
            Each place, each person, became a friend.
            The road, the sky, the world, so wide,
            Left their mark upon my mind.

        </pre>
        <pre>
            In the book of life, my journey's page,
            A story written, timeless, sage.
