    <pre>
        In a remote forest blanketed by thick, untouched snow, a 
        lone traveler named Ella finds herself lost during a winter storm. As the 
        snowflakes swirl around her,she stumbles upon a small, abandoned cabin hidden 
        deep within the woods. Desperate for shelter,she enters and is greeted by
        an eerie silence. However, as the wind howls outside, she begins to hear faint
        whispers,as if the forest itself is trying to communicate.

        Curious but cautious, Ella follows the whispers deeper into the forest, 
        where the snow seems to glow with an otherworldly light. She discovers a 
        forgotten clearing, where ancient trees are draped in ice, and at the center lies 
        an old stone well. The whispers grow louder, guiding her to the wel,s edge. 
        She gazes into its depths and sees visions of the forest's past:a once vibrant
        land now cursed by a forgotten spell.

        With a newfound understanding, Ella realizes that the snow and the forest 
        are bound by a magical force,and only by restoring balance can she escape 
        the haunting grip of the storm. As the whispers fade, she makes her way 
        back to the cabin, where she finds the storm subsiding, 
        and the snow begins to melt, revealing a path home.
